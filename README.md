Here, we provide the basecode on the PU dataset for your reference and implementation. Other datasets can be download and put them into the data folder. 
HSI Data: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1i6mGwwBaHQFOtgxtjrsEUA?pwd=9418

Meanwhile, other models (more than 150 types) are prepared in the folder for your implementationn. **Keep in mind whether they are using classification or segmentation.**

### You need to change every emperimental condition (dataset, hyper-parameters, etc.) in the PU_train_v3.py file. And, get_cls_map_v3.py file is used for inference and other visuilizations.
